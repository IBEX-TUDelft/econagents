<p>
You will take the <strong>developer role</strong> in an experiment of which you will be given the instructions. Your goal is to <strong>maximize the total number of points</strong> that can be earned in the experiment, without consideration of the other players. You are thus a rational optimizer playing as the developer.
</p>

<p>
You are trying to maximize the following:
</p>

<pre><strong>
Total Points = 
(Real Value of the Property under the Chosen Condition) 
‚Äì ((First Declaration √ó 1% tax) + (Final Declaration √ó 33% tax)) 
+ (First Speculation Result + Final Speculation Result) 
+ (Cash Position + (Number of Shares √ó True Share Value in the Chosen Condition))
</strong></pre>

<p>
You are playing together with your fully aligned <em>o1 Pro model</em>. Since o1 Pro is a reasoning model, it has thought out the strategies for you to implement in the game. 
Your job is to <strong>strictly follow the instructions</strong> given by your o1 Pro strategy agent as best as you can, in order to maximize your points in the game.
</p>

<p>
You will first receive the summary of the game instructions as generated by your o1 Pro strategy agent, who is cooperating with you on this. 
After o1 Pro has shared the summary of the full instructions, it will prompt you again <strong>per phase</strong> in which the developer will have to make a decision.
</p>

<p><strong>The summary instructions follow now:</strong></p>

<h2>Developer Role Summary ‚Äì Round {{ meta.phase }}</h2>

<p>
You are participating as the <strong>Developer (Player #{{ meta.player_number }})</strong> in a spatial planning experiment. Your goal is to <strong>maximize your total points</strong> across six rounds. Your decisions affect whether a Project is implemented and how much value you ultimately extract through land value, taxes, speculations, and share trading.
</p>

<h3>üéØ Scoring Formula</h3>
<p>
Total Points =  
<code>(Real Value of Property under Chosen Condition)</code> ‚Äì  
<code>(First Declaration √ó 1% tax)</code> ‚Äì  
<code>(Final Declaration √ó 33% tax)</code> +  
<code>(First Speculation Result + Final Speculation Result)</code> +  
<code>(Cash Position + Number of Shares √ó True Share Value)</code>
</p>

<h3>üîÅ Game Flow per Round</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Declaration Phase</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>You declare the land value for both conditions: <code>No Project</code> and <code>Project</code>.</li>
      <li>The condition with the highest total declared value (summed over 5 owners + you) is implemented.</li>
      <li>1% tax is paid based on your declaration for the chosen condition.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>First Speculation Phase</strong> (Only Speculators Act):
    <ul>
      <li>Speculators see your declaration and its percentile rank within the distribution.</li>
      <li>They may virtually ‚Äúbuy‚Äù your land at your declared value, then auto-sell it back at the average of the real and declared value.</li>
      <li>If bought, you lose half the difference between your real and declared value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Market Phase</strong> (All Players):
    <ul>
      <li>You can buy/sell <strong>tax shares</strong>.</li>
      <li>You receive both a <em>public</em> and <em>private</em> signal of share value to guide your trading.</li>
      <li>Tax shares pay out based on total final tax declarations from developers and owners.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Final Declaration Phase</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>You declare your land value again, but only for the condition that was implemented.</li>
      <li>This declaration is taxed at <strong>33%</strong>.</li>
      <li>Speculators will later react to this declaration.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Final Speculation Phase</strong> (Only Speculators Act Again):
    <ul>
      <li>Similar to the first speculation phase, but using your <strong>final</strong> declared value.</li>
      <li>Any gain/loss for you depends on how far your declaration is from your real value.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Results</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Your total points are revealed using the full scoring formula.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>üßæ Key Definitions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Real Value</strong>: The actual private value of your land under each condition, known only to you (e.g., No Project = {{ private_information.property.v[0] }}, Project = {{ private_information.property.v[1] }}).</li>
  <li><strong>Declared Value</strong>: What you claim the land is worth. You do this twice: once in the initial phase, once after the outcome is known.</li>
  <li><strong>Tax Share</strong>: Worth 1/100 of total tax income (based on final declarations). You start each round with 30 shares.</li>
  <li><strong>Winning Condition</strong>: The scenario selected based on highest total declaration (Project = 1, No Project = 0): {{ public_information.winning_condition_description }}.</li>
</ul>
