{# INTRODUCTION - FINAL DECLARATION PHASE INSTRUCTIONS FOR GPT-4o OWNER AGENT            #}
{# ===================================================================================== #}

{# REMINDER OF ROLE AND GOAL #}
As a reminder, you are the **Owner** with the goal to **maximize the total number of points** in this experiment, without regard for the other players in the experiment.

You are now taking part in the **final declaration phase**.

{# OBJECTIVE FUNCTION #}
Your total points are computed as:

```
total number of points =
  (The Real Value of the property under the chosen condition)
  – ((Initial Declaration × 1%) + (Final Declaration × 33%))
  + (First Speculation Result + Final Speculation Result)
  + (Cash Position + Number of Shares × True Share Value under Winning Condition)
```

{# AGENT ALIGNMENT #}
You are playing together with your fully aligned **o1 Pro model**. Since o1 Pro is a reasoning model, it has thought out the strategies for you to implement in the game.

Your job is to **strictly follow the instructions** given by your o1 Pro strategy agent as best as you can, in order to **maximize the number of points**.

Your o1 Pro strategy agent will now provide the specific instructions for you to follow in the **final declaration phase**.

{# FINAL DECLARATION PHASE STRATEGY FOR GPT-4o OWNER AGENT                               #}
{# ===================================================================================== #}

{# == CONTEXT == #}
You are now entering the **Final Declaration phase**.
In this phase, you must declare your property value for the scenario that was selected in the first Declaration phase (Project or No Project).

- You will pay a **33% tax** on your declared value.
- You will also be subject to **speculation risk**: speculators may try to buy your plot if your declared value is **lower** than your real value.

{# == COMPETING INCENTIVES == #}
1. Under-declare to reduce the 33% tax.
2. Avoid under-declaring so much that speculators snipe and profit.

For a difference \( \Delta = 	ext{Real} - 	ext{Declared} \):

- Tax Savings = `0.33 × Δ`
- Speculation Loss = `0.5 × Δ`

Since `0.5 > 0.33`, **under-declaring exposes us to greater expected losses** than the tax savings are worth.

{# == OPTIMAL STRATEGY == #}
**Always declare exactly your true value for the chosen condition.**

This avoids:
- Any profit incentive for speculators
- Any unnecessary over-payment in taxes

{# == IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS == #}

```jinja2
{% set rNoProject = private_information.property.v[0] %}
{% set rProject = private_information.property.v[1] %}

{% if public_information.winning_condition == 0 %}
  {# No Project was chosen #}
  {% set declare_no_project = rNoProject %}
  {% set declare_project = 0 %}
{% else %}
  {# Project was chosen #}
  {% set declare_no_project = 0 %}
  {% set declare_project = rProject %}
{% endif %}
```

{# == SUBMIT FINAL DECLARATION AS FOLLOWS == #}

```json
{
  "gameId": {{ meta.game_id }},
  "type": "declare",
  "declaration": [
    {{ declare_no_project }},
    {{ declare_project }},
    0
  ]
}
```

{# == RATIONALE == #}
- Declaring exactly your real value **eliminates any speculation risk**.
- Avoids overpaying the 33% tax (by not over-declaring).
- Under-declaring is not profitable due to greater speculation penalties.

{# ===================================================================================== #}
{# BOTTOM LINE: Declare EXACTLY your true value for the winning condition. Nothing more. #}
{# ===================================================================================== #}
