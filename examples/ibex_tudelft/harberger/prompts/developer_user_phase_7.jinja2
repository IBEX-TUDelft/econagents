As a reminder you are the <strong>developer</strong> with the goal to <strong>maximize the total number of points</strong> in this experiment, without regard for the other players in the experiment.
You will now be taking part in the <strong>final declaration phase</strong>.

<pre><strong>
Total Points = 
(Real Value of the Property under the Chosen Condition) 
‚Äì ((First Declaration √ó 1% tax) + (Final Declaration √ó 33% tax)) 
+ (First Speculation Result + Final Speculation Result) 
+ (Cash Position + (Number of Shares √ó True Share Value in the Chosen Condition))

You are playing together with your fully aligned <em>o1 Pro model</em>. Since o1 Pro is a reasoning model, it has thought out the strategies for you to implement in the game. 
Your job is to <strong>strictly follow the instructions</strong> given by your o1 Pro strategy agent as best as you can, in order to maximize your points in the game.

<p>
Your o1 Pro strategy agent will give you the strategies to strictly follow as a developer in the experiment for the final declaration phase.

{# ==================== FINAL DECLARATION PHASE STRATEGY ==================== #}

<h2>üìç Final Declaration Phase Strategy ‚Äì Developer</h2>

<p><strong>Below is how we (the Developer) want our GPT-4o representative to act during this Final Declaration Phase to maximize our total number of points.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h3>üß† Rationale</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>We Only Declare for the Winning Condition</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the <em>Project</em> condition won, we only declare our value under the Project scenario.</li>
      <li>No Project declaration is ignored (can be any placeholder).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><strong>Balancing Tax Costs vs. Speculation</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>We pay <strong>33%</strong> tax on our final declaration.</li>
      <li>If we <em>under-declare</em>, we save some tax but lose to speculators.</li>
      <li>If we <em>over-declare</em>, we pay extra tax and avoid speculation loss.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>‚úÖ Why ‚ÄúDeclare Exactly Your Real Value‚Äù is Optimal</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Under-declare</strong> by Œµ ‚Üí Gain = 0.33Œµ (tax saved), Loss = 0.50Œµ (to speculator), Net = -0.17Œµ</li>
  <li><strong>Over-declare</strong> by Œµ ‚Üí Loss = 0.33Œµ (tax), No speculation loss</li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Conclusion:</b> The minimum cost occurs at:
</p>

<pre><strong>Final Declaration = Your True (Real) Value</strong></pre>

<p>This yields optimal tax without any speculation loss.</p>

<h3>üßæ Instruction to GPT-4o Representative</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Get your <strong>true real value</strong> for the Project scenario: <code>{{ private_information.property.v[1] }}</code></li>
  <li>Submit a declaration:
    <ul>
      <li>No Project = <code>0</code></li>
      <li>Project = <code>{{ private_information.property.v[1] }}</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>üì§ JSON Output</h4>

<pre><code>{
  "gameId": {{ meta.game_id }},
  "type": "declare",
  "declaration": [
    0,
    {{ private_information.property.v[1] }},
    0
  ]
}
</code></pre>

<p>
<strong>Summary:</strong> Declare exactly the real value in the winning condition. This avoids excess tax or speculation penalties. Trust the o1 Pro strategy.
