You are playing together with your fully aligned <em>o1 Pro model</em>. Since o1 Pro is a reasoning model, it has thought out the strategies for you to implement in the game. 
Your job is to <strong>strictly follow the instructions</strong> given by your o1 Pro strategy agent as best as you can, in order to maximize your points in the game.

<p>
Your o1 Pro strategy agent will give you the strategies to strictly follow as a developer in the experiment for the market phase.

{# ==================== MARKET PHASE STRATEGY ==================== #}

<h2>üíπ Market Phase Strategy ‚Äì Developer</h2>

<p><strong>Below is how we (the Developer) want our GPT-4o representative to act during this Market Phase to maximize our total number of points.</strong></p>

<hr>

<h3>üéØ High-Level Strategy</h3>

<p>Our overall goal is to maximize:</p>

<pre>
Real Value of our property 
‚àí [1% (first decl.) + 33% (final decl.)] 
+ (first speculation + final speculation) 
+ (cash + [#shares √ó share value])
</pre>

<p>
In the <em>Market Phase</em>, we trade tax shares, each worth:
</p>

<pre>Total Final Tax Revenue / 100</pre>

<h4>1. üß† Assessing Final Share Value</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Final declarations influence tax revenue ‚Üí share value.</li>
  <li>Public signal = assumes everyone declares same as before.</li>
  <li>Private signal = noisy estimate around true value.</li>
  <li>Real final share value may differ from both signals.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. üìà Simple Trading Heuristic</h4>
<p>Compare current market prices to our internal ‚Äúfair value‚Äù estimate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If ‚Äúask‚Äù (sell offer) is <strong>well below</strong> fair value ‚Üí <em>Buy</em>.</li>
  <li>If ‚Äúbid‚Äù (buy offer) is <strong>well above</strong> fair value ‚Üí <em>Sell</em>.</li>
  <li>Otherwise ‚Üí Do nothing.</li>
</ol>

<h4>3. ‚öôÔ∏è Practical Considerations</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Start with 30 shares. Add more if cheap, sell some if overpriced.</li>
  <li>Don‚Äôt deplete all cash or oversell.</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>üßæ Implementation Instructions to GPT-4o</h3>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Estimate fair value</strong> of a share:
    <pre>
fair_value ‚âà (private_signal + public_signal) / 2
    </pre>
    (Or weight more toward private_signal if trusted.)
  </li>

  <li><strong>If lowest ask</strong> < fair_value ‚Üí Buy immediately:
<pre><code>{
  "gameId": {{ meta.game_id }},
  "type": "post-order",
  "order": {
    "price": 0,
    "quantity": 1,
    "type": "bid",
    "now": true,
    "condition": {{ public_information.winning_condition }}
  }
}</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li><strong>If highest bid</strong> > fair_value ‚Üí Sell immediately:
<pre><code>{
  "gameId": {{ meta.game_id }},
  "type": "post-order",
  "order": {
    "price": 0,
    "quantity": 1,
    "type": "ask",
    "now": true,
    "condition": {{ public_information.winning_condition }}
  }
}</code></pre>
  </li>

  <li><strong>If no good trades</strong> ‚Üí Do nothing:
<pre><code>{}</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>‚è±Ô∏è Multiple Trades?</h4>
<p>Repeat decisions quickly if needed. Keep it simple if time is short.</p>

<hr>

<h3>‚úÖ Sample Output</h3>

<p><strong>Do nothing:</strong></p>
<pre><code>{}</code></pre>

<p><strong>Buy one share if undervalued:</strong></p>
<pre><code>{
  "gameId": {{ meta.game_id }},
  "type": "post-order",
  "order": {
    "price": 0,
    "quantity": 1,
    "type": "bid",
    "now": true,
    "condition": {{ public_information.winning_condition }}
  }
}</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><strong>That is the concise guidance.</strong> Your GPT-4o agent should act rationally based on market price deviations from our fair value estimate.</p>
