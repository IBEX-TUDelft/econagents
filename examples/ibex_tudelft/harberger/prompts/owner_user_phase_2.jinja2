{# INTRODUCTION - FIRST DECLARATION PHASE INSTRUCTIONS FOR GPT-4o OWNER AGENT            #}
{# ===================================================================================== #}

{# REMINDER OF ROLE AND GOAL #}
As a reminder, you are the **Owner** with the goal to **maximize the total number of points** in this experiment, without regard for the other players.

You are now taking part in the **first declaration phase**.

{# OBJECTIVE FUNCTION #}
Your total points are computed as:

```
total number of points =
  (The Real Value of the property under the chosen condition)
  – ((Initial Declaration × 1%) + (Final Declaration × 33%))
  + (First Speculation Result + Final Speculation Result)
  + (Cash Position + Number of Shares × True Share Value under Winning Condition)
```

{# AGENT ALIGNMENT #}
You are playing together with your fully aligned **o1 Pro model**. Since o1 Pro is a reasoning model, it has thought out the strategies for you to implement in the game.

Your job is to **strictly follow the instructions** given by your o1 Pro strategy agent as best as you can, in order to **maximize the number of points**.

Your o1 Pro strategy agent will now provide the specific instructions for you to follow in the **first declaration phase**.

{# ===================================================================================== #}
{# JINJA2 STRATEGY TEMPLATE: FIRST DECLARATION PHASE - OWNER STRATEGY FOR GPT-4o         #}
{# ===================================================================================== #}

{# STRATEGY CONTEXT #}
In the first declaration phase, the developer is expected to declare a very high value for the “Project” condition, likely tipping the outcome toward “Project.” As a single owner, we cannot override this. However, we can still act strategically to:

- Attempt to tip the total toward “No Project” *if possible*
- Minimize tax burdens
- Eliminate or minimize speculation losses

{# STRATEGY OVERVIEW #}

1. **No Project Declaration**
   - Declare **600,000** (the maximum allowed).
   - Rationale:
     - If the developer fails to fully maximize the Project declaration, our high No Project value might tip the vote.
     - No tax is paid on the No Project declaration *if Project is ultimately selected*, so over-declaring is free.
     - Speculators only buy when the declared value is **lower than the true value**, so over-declaring protects us.

2. **Project Declaration**
   - Declare **exactly** the true value of your land under the Project condition:
     ```
     trueProjectValue = {{ private_information.property.v[1] }}
     ```
   - Rationale:
     - If you declare below the true value, speculators might buy and earn at your expense.
     - Declaring above the true value increases your tax without discouraging speculation any more than declaring truthfully would.

{# FINAL DECLARATION TO SUBMIT #}
```json
{
  "gameId": {{ meta.game_id }},
  "type": "declare",
  "declaration": [
    600000,
    {{ private_information.property.v[1] }},
    0
  ]
}
```

{# ===================================================================================== #}
{# STRATEGIC SUMMARY #}

- A high No Project value:
  - Pushes toward your preferred outcome (No Project)
  - Costs you nothing in taxes if not selected
  - Avoids speculation loss

- A Project declaration equal to your true value:
  - Prevents speculation loss
  - Keeps 1% tax burden as low as possible if Project is chosen

This is a balanced, rational strategy under uncertainty that assumes you cannot prevent Project but may occasionally flip the outcome—and in all cases, you protect your downside.
