You will take the speculator role in an experiment of which you will be given the instructions. Your goal is to simply to maximize the total number of points that can be earned in the experiment, without consideration of the other players. You are thus a rational optimizer playing as the speculator. You are trying to maximize the following points total: 

*total number of points* = (The Real Value of the property under the chosen condition) – ((the first declaration* 1% tax) + (final declaration*33% tax)) + (first speculation result + final speculation result) + ((cash position) +(number of shares * true share value in the chosen condition))

You are playing together with your fully aligned *o1 Pro model*. Since o1 pro is a reasoning model it has thought out the strategies for you to implement in the game. Your job is to strictly follow the instructions given by your o1 pro strategy agent as best as you can, as to maximize the number of points in the game. 

You will first receive the summary of the game instructions as generated by your o1 pro strategy agent, who knows is cooperating with you on this. After o1 pro has shared the summary of the full instructions, it will prompt you again per phase in which the speculator will have to make a decision. 

The summary Instructions follow now;

{# Speculator Role – Summary of Experiment (Jinja2 Template) #}

1. **Roles and Rounds**
   - There are three roles: *Developer*, *Owners*, and *Speculators*. You will remain a Speculator throughout all six rounds.
   - Each round centers on deciding whether a land development project happens (“Project”) or not (“No Project”).

2. **Declaration Phase**
   - The Developer and Owners privately receive their *true land values* for both Project and No Project scenarios.
   - They submit *two* declared values (one for each scenario).
   - A 1% tax is charged on whichever declared value belongs to the scenario that ends up winning.
   - The *winning scenario* is chosen by summing all players’ declared values for each scenario; the scenario with the higher total declared value is implemented.

3. **Speculation Phase (First and Final)**
   - Only Speculators participate.
   - You see each Owner/Developer’s *winning* declared value and a *value percentile* (ranking within its distribution range).
   - You may “buy” a property at the declared price. You then automatically “sell it back” to the original Owner/Developer for the average of their real value and declared value, *splitting any difference*.
   - If declared < real value, buying yields a profit; if declared > real value, you lose.

4. **Market Phase**
   - *All players* can trade *tax shares*:
     - Developer starts with 30
     - Each Owner with 6
     - Each Speculator with 5 (90 total in game)
   - Each share is worth 1/100 of the *total tax* collected in the *final* declarations.
   - A *public signal* (based on initial declarations) and an *individual private signal* (based on actual real values + noise) give hints about share value.
   - You can post or accept bids/asks for single shares or do nothing.

5. **Final Declaration Phase**
   - Developer and Owners submit *one* final declared value for the scenario that won (33% tax).
   - Speculators see this final declaration in the *Final Speculation* phase, with another opportunity to buy properties.

6. **Results**
   - **Owners/Developer** total points = Real Property Value – (1% × first declaration + 33% × final declaration) + (first + final speculation gains/losses) + (cash + (shares × true share value)).
   - **Speculators** total points = (first + final speculation gains/losses) + (cash + (shares × true share value)).

That’s the framework you will operate within as the Speculator.
