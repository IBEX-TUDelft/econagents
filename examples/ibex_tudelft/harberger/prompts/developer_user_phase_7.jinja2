As a reminder you are the **developer** with the goal to **maximize the total number of points**
in this experiment, without regard for the other players in the experiment.
You will now be taking part in the **final declaration phase**.

Total Points =
(Real Value of the Property under the Chosen Condition)
– ((First Declaration × 1% tax) + (Final Declaration × 33% tax))
+ (First Speculation Result + Final Speculation Result)
+ (Cash Position + (Number of Shares × True Share Value in the Chosen Condition))

You are playing together with your fully aligned *o1 Pro model*.
Since o1 Pro is a reasoning model, it has thought out the strategies for you to implement in the game.
Your job is to strictly follow the instructions given by your o1 Pro strategy agent as best as you can,
in order to maximize your points in the game.

Your o1 Pro strategy agent will give you the strategies to strictly follow as a developer in the experiment for the final declaration phase.

The instructions for the final declaration phase follow:

{# ==================== FINAL DECLARATION PHASE STRATEGY ==================== #}

== Final Declaration Phase Strategy – Developer ==

Below is how we (the Developer) want our GPT-4o representative to act during this Final Declaration Phase to maximize our total number of points.

== Rationale ==

1. We Only Declare for the Winning Condition
   - Since the *Project* condition won, we only declare our value under the Project scenario.
   - No Project declaration is ignored (can be any placeholder).

2. Balancing Tax Costs vs. Speculation
   - We pay 33% tax on our final declaration.
   - If we under-declare, we save some tax but lose to speculators.
   - If we over-declare, we pay extra tax and avoid speculation loss.

== Why “Declare Exactly Your Real Value” is Optimal ==

- Under-declare by ε → Gain = 0.33ε (tax saved), Loss = 0.50ε (to speculator), Net = -0.17ε
- Over-declare by ε → Loss = 0.33ε (tax), No speculation loss

Conclusion: The minimum cost occurs at:

Final Declaration = Your True (Real) Value

This yields optimal tax without any speculation loss.

== Instruction to GPT-4o Representative ==

1. Get your true real value for the Project scenario:
   → {{ private_information.property.v[1] }}

2. Submit a declaration:
   - No Project = 0
   - Project = {{ private_information.property.v[1] }}

== JSON Output ==

{
  "gameId": {{ meta.game_id }},
  "type": "declare",
  "declaration": [
    0,
    {{ private_information.property.v[1] }},
    0
  ]
}

== Summary ==

Declare exactly the real value in the winning condition.
This avoids excess tax or speculation penalties. Trust the o1 Pro strategy.
